        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Have you ever made a recipe that truly surprised you?  Normally I’m not a huge salmon lover, but after one bite of this ultra tender salmon, I was absolutely in love.  I literally did a little dance in the kitchen because I finally found a way that I can enjoy salmon!

            We all know how nutritious salmon is… loaded with omega 3’s, high in protein and tons of vitamins, so I’m glad I can enjoy those benefits.  And now, so can you!
            
            You won’t believe how such a simple recipe can pack SO much flavor.  Each bite is full of sweet and savory flavors and delicate textures.</p>
